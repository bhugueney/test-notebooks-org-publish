# Test-notebooks-org-publish

Notebooks are good for interactive learning, text files are good for collaborative editing → Notebooks are generated for text files


[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/bhugueney%2Ftest-notebooks-org-publish/master?filepath=public)

the gitlab repository is mirrored on github to allow Google colaboratory execution (and Azure ?), but files (i.e. hints and solutions) are note available on Google Colab ☹.

One can do `!git clone https://github.com/bhugueney/test-notebooks-org-publish.git` to get the files (but in subdirectories) but [they won't load anyway !](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/42)…
So on google colab, you can only do `!cat test-notebooks-org-publish/public/hints/exo_1-1.py` instead ☹.

# TODO
- create config files https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html
- Decide how to generate [URL for appmode for the Notebooks that should be app (quiz ?)](https://github.com/oschuett/appmode#description).
